Quiz about JavaScript fundamentals with timer & score-board

## Description
This project is a multiple choice timed quiz. The user has 60 seconds to answer 3 questions. Every correct answer will log 10 points. However, for every incorrect answer the timer will subtract 10 seconds. When the time runs out or when all the questions are answered, the option to enter the users nickname will appear and if the user submits their score then their score will be stored locally to a high-score board.
